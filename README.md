# Building a simple Voting App using Kustomize and Kubernetes 🚀

This repository contains the **resource Manifests for a simple Voting App** that is built using Kustomize and Kubernetes. This Voting App is a simple web application that allows users to **Vote for their favorite pets**. 

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

**The Voting App consists of the following components:**

- A `Frontend Service` that serves the web application to users to **vote for their favorite pets** (cats or dogs). It is Developed using **Python Flask**.
- A `Redis Service` that **stores the votes**.
- A `Worker Service` that **processes the votes and stores them in the Postgres databas**. It is Written in **.NET**.
- A `Postgres Service` that stores the **details of the votes such as the pet name and the number of votes.**
- A `Result Service` that **displays the results of the votes**. It is Written in **Node.js**.
